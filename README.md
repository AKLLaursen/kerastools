This is a library containing various helper functions and classes for doing deep learning in [Keras](https://keras.io). Most of the functions are made by [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) and [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel) as part of the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai) [deep learning course](http://course.fast.ai). I have extended, commented, updated to Keras 2.x, and converted most of the code using the [sequential API](https://keras.io/models/sequential/) of Keras to the [functional API](https://keras.io/models/model/) of Keras.
